Hey, I am Larry Z, currently a senior studying CS. 
I'm interested in PL theory and also software engineering.

This is my personal website, hosting my thoughts, learning notes, 
and some projects. 

I'm currently learning DCC, logical relations, 
and parametricity, 
trying to learn rust and write a linear kernel, 
and dipping my hand into game dev. 

Trying to tell a good story. 

I'm into bouldering and rock climbing in my free time. 
If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Portland), 
maybe we can code together or climb together.

:)
