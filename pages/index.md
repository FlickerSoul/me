Hey, I am Larry Z, currently a senior studying CS. 
I'm interested in PL theory and also software engineering.

This is my personal website, hosting my thoughts, learning notes, 
and some projects. 

I'm currently learning DCC, logical relations, 
and parametricity, 
trying to learn rust and write a linux kernel, 
and dipping my hand into game dev. Building this website is also 
one of my time killers.

My long term goal is to become a good researcher and a good engineer. 
Alongside of that, I would like to tell a good story and build exquisite 
products. 

I'm into bouldering and rock climbing in my free time. 
If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Portland), 
maybe we can code together or climb together.

:)
