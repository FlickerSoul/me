It's been 2 months since I arrived in the UK and started my new academic life here. 
Many things have happened since my graduation in May and my mindset has gone 
through many iterations. I finally have a chance to summarize more than 6 month of time 
since my last update. 

I felt the urge to write this because of Ed's concert yesterday. 
That was an amazing time. Ed played through the newest album Autumn Variation
with a band and several of his old iconic songs on guitar and the loop station.
I appreciate every moment of it and couldn't help but recorded it. I wanted to
record every moment.

I understand the concert was not just between performers and me: thousands of people 
participated in this experience. There were people recording and taking photos
like me, people singing along, and, of course, people who arrived late 
and kept moving in and out. I was annoyed by few around me, who obstructed me 
remembering and cherishing this moment, many many many times. 
However, I'm not writing this to complain about them, but to question a thought appeared in my mind at the moment. 

"This moment is so short. How should I save it?"

Acknowledging this thought, I panicked, holding my phone tight and wanting to 
make the perfect recording. As I was looking at the moving pixels
on my phone screen, my mind suggested "then make more moments", 
lacking certainty and determination.

I was panicking, sensing the moments I spent in the US fading away, feeling my dream 
and the American dream drifting further from me. "Would this moment be one of them?", I asked myself silently. 

I was scared by time, starting realizing my youth has flowed away, without any indication. 
Ed was in most part of my teenage life. Some people say his music is cheesy, but I 
don't care. His voice and lyrics has been a medium of my emotion since 2016, when I 
first heard Thinking Out Loud on stage of the Grammy award. It's a time when we played Multiply mainly on his guitar and loop station. He himself was his band. Yesterday, he played 
Autumn Variation with a band, which has always been he's dream when he started 
his career. At that moment, I realized he has gone a long way, and so am I. 
He's familiar but never the same person I knew, and so am I. 

The last 6 months has taught me that life goes on and I have to live in the moment,
not the past, not the future. I made the decision to come to the UK with 
pain, sadness, and a vague career path. At the moment, I didn't know what to do 
but grief. Going through the pain, I realized no one would save me.
