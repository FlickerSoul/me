abstract: I got two Yubico keys and they are cool!
---

I got two security keys from [yubico](https://www.yubico.com/) and paired most of my important accounts with the keys.

Yubico offers 6 kinds security keys for general customers. The ones I got support both Type-C ports and NFC. Others kinds of keys include USB-A/NFC, C-Lightning, mini Type-C, mini Type-A, and Type-C only. There was an promotion offered by CloudFlare a few months ago but I missed because my account has access to two accounts and I got disoriented by that. The student promotion offered by yubico allowed me to purchase these two keys for 90$.

In terms of user experience, the security keys are a bit slower than one-time password (OTP) because I have to insert the key and tap on it to confirm using it whereas I can fill in OTP with just one click with my password manager. The deliberateness makes me want to by the mini Type-C key since I can keep the key connected with my computer all the time. BUT, my wallet is quite flat now. For simplicity and convenience, I paired only the keys with my important accounts that don't get logged in unknown environment often. Everything should be pretty secure right now; all I can do is pray the careless me won't lose the physical key...

下一个要做的是处理一下图像的压缩，可能写个Vite的插件看看，在 build 的时候转化退片

The next goal is to work on image compression. Maybe I should write a Vite plugin so that it can shrink images during compile time.
