# Universe.Observer's Blog 

This is the source code of my blog. 
I had several blogs before, all powered by WordPress. 
The first dated back to 2013, when I was in junior 
high school. WordPress was awesome. It has fancy GUI 
that allowed me edit header, footer, sidebars, etc. 
without any coding knowledge. But the biggest complaint 
I had was that it was too slow and the writing experience 
was not smooth. My last blog has been taken down for quite 
a while now and the urge of writing has haunted me since then. 
I need something simple, pretty, fast, and enjoyable to use. 
This is my attempt to fill the hole. I want to write again. I 
want to feel alive again.
